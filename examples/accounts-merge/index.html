      <h5 class="text-start">Merge the given list of email accounts</h5>
      <ul class="text-start">
        <li>
          Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of
          strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the
          rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely
          belong to the same person if there is some common email to both
          accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may
          belong to different people as people could have the same name. A
          person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their
          accounts definitely have the same name.
        </li>
        <li>
          After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following
          format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of
          the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can
          be returned in any order.
        </li>
      </ul>
