## Word Ladder

The wordLadder algorithm finds the shortest transformation sequence from the beginWord to the endWord using words from the wordList. It uses BFS to explore possible word transformations by changing one character at a time and checking if the new word exists in the wordList.

The algorithm builds a queue to track the words to be processed in the next step. It continues the process until the endWord is found or all transformations are exhausted, and it returns the number of steps needed to reach the endWord. If no transformation is possible, it returns 0.
